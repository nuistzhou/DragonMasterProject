__Main goal:__ Find the best country/region on earth according to a living quality index based on:  
1. Hazard frequency and distribution;  
2. Air pollution;  
3. GDP;  
4. Average year NDVI.  

_Warning: Running the entire script takes about 2 hours of computation time in the 2 core virtual machine we used. We highly recommend using the terminal._

The results html and the R notebook are available for download in this Dropbox [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/s5g2y9cfqx3zs56/AAA91t_ScCdA3f0jTm8PlMmka?dl=1). This repository takes about 15 minutes to download.
