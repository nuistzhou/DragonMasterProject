__Main goal:__ Find the best country/region on earth according to a living quality index based on:
1. Hazard frequency and distribution;
2. Air pollution;
3. GDP;
4. Average year NDVI.

__Warning: Running the entire script takes about 2 hours of computation time in the 2 core virtual machine we used. We highly recommend using the terminal.__
